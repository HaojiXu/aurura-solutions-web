One-paged description for Aurura Solutions, connectivity for the Open Web.

## Philosophy
At the heart of Aurura Solutions is the responsibility of an open web. As the world came to 21st century and more mobile-oriented, internet services became ever growingly centralized. This led to various problems, including the lack of control of privacy, inconvenience for users to travel between services, companies holding the rights of user-created data, and much more. Legislations began to deal with it, sure. But citizens, consumers and developers could also make an impact on these gargantual multi-nation cooperations.
